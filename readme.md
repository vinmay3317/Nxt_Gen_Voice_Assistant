# AI Voice Assistant with Advanced Features

Welcome to the AI Voice Assistant project! This project is a comprehensive and advanced voice assistant created using Python. It incorporates various Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) techniques to provide a wide range of functionalities beyond the capabilities of typical voice assistants.

## Features

1. **Voice Command Handling**: The assistant can handle a variety of voice commands for different tasks.
2. **System Control**: Control system functions such as volume and brightness adjustment, opening and closing applications, and system shutdown.
3. **Hand Gesture Control**: Operate the assistant on any monitor screen using hand gestures, making interaction touch-free.
4. **Code Generation**: Generate code based on user prompts using advanced AI models.
5. **Image Generation**: Generate and save images based on user prompts.
6. **GPT Integration**: Utilize GPT for more accurate and context-aware responses to user queries.
7. **Screen Management**: Take screenshots and record the screen with voice commands.
8. **Email Composition**: Compose and send emails with the help of AI.
9. **Multitasking**: Perform tasks like playing music, creating presentations, and more.
10. **Pause and Sleep Mode**: Temporarily stop listening to commands or put the assistant in sleep mode.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries: `os`, `pygame`, `random`, `re`, `time`, `pyautogui`, `threading`, `pywhatkit`, `speech_recognition`, `datetime`, `screen_brightness_control`, `gpt4_free`

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vinmay3317/Nxt_Gen_Voice_Assistant.git
   cd ai-voice-assistant
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Assistant**:
   ```bash
   python assistant.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the assistant is running, you can interact with it using voice commands. Here are some example commands:

- **General Queries**:
  - "How are you?"
  - "What are you doing?"
  - "Who created you?"

- **System Control**:
  - "Volume up"
  - "Volume down"
  - "Increase brightness"
  - "Take screenshot after 5 seconds"
  - "Record screen for 10 seconds"
  - "Shutdown"

- **Hand Gesture Control**:
  - "Now I want to control the screen with my hand"
  - "Stop hand gesture"

- **Entertainment and Utility**:
  - "Play [song name]"
  - "Open Visual Studio Code"
  - "Create a presentation on [topic]"
  - "Generate image with prompt [description]"

- **Email and Notes**:
  - "Write an email"
  - "Take a note"

- **Games and Fun**:
  - "Coin toss game"

## Advanced Functionalities

### Hand Gesture Control

The hand gesture control feature allows you to operate the assistant without touching the screen. To enable this feature, use the command:
```plaintext
Now I want to control the screen with my hand
```
To stop, use:
```plaintext
Stop hand gesture
```

### Email Composition

The assistant can compose and send emails for you. When prompted to write an email, follow the instructions to provide the recipient's email, subject, and content.

### Image and Presentation Generation

Leverage the assistant's ability to generate images and create presentations. Provide a prompt or topic, and the assistant will handle the rest, saving you time and effort.

## Customization

You can customize the assistant by modifying the code to add or change functionalities as per your requirements. The modular structure of the code makes it easy to integrate new features.
